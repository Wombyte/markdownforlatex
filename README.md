# Markdown For Latex

This is a VsCode-Extension for my markdown-ish syntax that creates PDF-Files via latex.

<br>

## Requirements

The following requirements have to be fulfilled:

-   the command `pdflatex.exe -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode ${fileName} -aux-directory=build` has to work

Yet no further dependencies have to be installed.

<br>

## Extension Settings

Settings in `contributes.configuration`:

-   `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
-   customization commands for the note commands

<br>

* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets
